		                                	During my last semester in school, I was putting school on the backburner to work on some business ideas I had. Unfortunately, a consequence of this is that I bombed my first Operating Systems exam. I needed this class, so if I didn't get at least a C, I wouldn't be able to graduate.<br><br>I'd never done so poorly on an exam before, and since the exam grades were a huge portion of the final grade, it would be super tough for me to get the C needed to pass, and nearly impossible to get anything higher than that.<br><br>I committed myself to learning OS and getting a good grade on the final two exams. With only a day before the second exam, I studied for hours, read 300+ pages of the textbook, and did tens of practice exercises. I managed to beat the class average by 10 points.<br><br>Before the final exam, I told one of my friends my goal to get a B on the final, all that they said is that it would be impossible.<br><br>This just fired me up, and I studied harder then I'd ever studied. By the time the final rolled around, I had learned a ton about Operating Systems and crushed the class average to get a B on the test and B in the class.
